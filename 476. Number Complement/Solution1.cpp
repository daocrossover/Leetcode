// Description:
// Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

// Example 1:
// Input: num = 5
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

// Example 2:
// Input: num = 1
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 
// Constraints:
// 1. The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
// 2. num >= 1
// 3. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

// XOR Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        long i = 1;
        // find the highest one bit and left shift once
        while (i <= num) {
            i <<= 1;
        }
        // num XOR all 1
        return (int)(i-1) ^ num;
    }
};
